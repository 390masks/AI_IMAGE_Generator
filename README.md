React AI Image Generator – Project Description
The AI Image Generator is a React-based web application that utilizes OpenAI’s image generation API to create images from user-provided text prompts. This project allows users to input a description, generate an AI-created image, and download the result.

✨ Features:
✔️ User Input Prompt: Users can enter a text prompt to describe the image they want.
✔️ AI Image Generation: Uses OpenAI’s API to generate images based on the prompt.
✔️ Image Display: Displays the generated image directly on the webpage.
✔️ Download Option: Allows users to download the generated image.
✔️ Loading Indicator: Shows a message while the image is being generated.

🔧 Technologies Used:
React.js – For building the frontend UI
Axios – For making API requests
OpenAI API – To generate AI-powered images
Environment Variables (.env) – To securely store the API key
📌 How It Works:
1️⃣ User enters a prompt in the input field.
2️⃣ Clicks the "Generate" button.
3️⃣ The app sends a request to OpenAI’s API with the prompt.
4️⃣ OpenAI responds with a generated image.
5️⃣ The image is displayed, and the user can download it.

This project is a great way to practice React hooks (useState), API integration, and handling asynchronous requests in React. 🚀
